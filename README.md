Our project is decentralised exchange. Decentralised exchange is a peer to peer crypto currency trading without any central authority .
In this project we are using automated market makers decentralised exchange , where the smart contracts plays a role of centralised authority, by defining the set of rules that dex has to follow .
In our project we have deployed our ERC20 dex contract. Then comes the liquidity pool which reserves the assets shared by the user,if the user is having more share in liquidity pool,he will be having more power on the pool and gets income by trading.
In our case we have eth to token liquidity pool.We have created some ERC20 tokens from the thirdweb.
